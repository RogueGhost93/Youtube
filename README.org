After many years of using ytdl I managed to come up with this simple script that will perfectly orginize all of my downloads into a desired folder structure. This is an alternative to software like youtube archivist, tubesync and the latest one I started using ytdl-sub which provides much more advanced usage of yt-dlp, but for noobs or just a simple download of youtube content this script is perfect. Enjoy!
